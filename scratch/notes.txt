PDF

Consider using plugins for PDF generation and Rendering

1- PDFMAKE http://pdfmake.org/#/  OR PDFKIT http://pdfkit.org 

2- PDF.JS or pdfjs (The Mozilla browser plugin for rendering pdfs) https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/# 
    We shall user angular's implementation of this plugin to minimize code. https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-pdf-viewer
    npm install ng2-pdf-viewer --save


ARCHIVES FOR IMPORT/EXPORT

    1- JSZIP (https://stuk.github.io/jszip/)
        npm install jszip
    2- cordova-plugin-zip (https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/cordova-plugin-zip)

            1) First i installed the cordova plugin

            $ ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-zip

            2) Then I think I had to declare it like this since there was something funky going on with the import... you declare this variable right beneath/after your "import" statements

            //cordova zip integration... declared at the top of the .ts file you're planning to use it in
            declare var zip: any;

            3) Create a public variable inside your class

            public zip:any;

            4) Then use it as the docs explain

            zip.unzip(res.nativeURL, destPath, doneCallback);
            zip.unzip(<source zip>, <destination dir>, <callback>, [<progressCallback>]);

            Hope that helps... sorry it's not very thorough!
